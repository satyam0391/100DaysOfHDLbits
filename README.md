# 💡 100 Days of HDLBits

Welcome to my **#100DaysOfHDLBits** challenge — a committed journey to mastering **Digital Logic Design** and **Verilog HDL** using the incredible learning platform: [HDLBits](https://hdlbits.01xz.net/wiki/Main_Page).

---

## 🎯 Objective

The main goals of this challenge are to:
- Strengthen my fundamentals in **digital electronics** and **combinational/sequential logic**.
- Build fluency in writing **clean Verilog** through hands-on problem-solving.
- Practice consistently and create a valuable Verilog resource for others.
- Share my journey to inspire beginners exploring RTL and HDL design.

> 💡 *“Digital logic is not just zeros and ones — it's the foundation of modern computing.”*  
> — *Join me on this journey and let's learn Verilog the HDLBits way!*

## 🧠 What I’ll Be Doing

Each day, I will:
- Solve 1–2 exercises from the **HDLBits** problem set.
- Design the Verilog module based on the question.
- Capture screenshots of the **question**, **solution**, and **timing diagram** from HDLBits.
- Upload everything in a neatly structured folder.
- Write brief notes or explanation for the logic implemented.

## 📁 What You’ll Find Here

Each day/problem will typically include:
- ✅ A clean and modular **Verilog solution** (.v)
- 🖼️ **Screenshot of the Question** from HDLBits
- 📷 **Screenshot of the HDLBits Solution Output**
- ⏱️ **Timing Diagram Image** for simulation behavior
- 📝 A short explanation or logic summary (optional)
